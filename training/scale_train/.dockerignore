# .scaletrain_ignore - generated by Scale Train CLI.

# Use this file like you would a .gitignore, except instead of skipping version control, these
# paths are ignored in scaletrain builds, so they do not get added to the docker build context.
# This contents of this file will also be copied into a .dockerignore file that will be used
# to ignore files during the containerization of your training code.
